## Case Study: 3Hunna’s Google Funding Journey

**Background:**  
3Hunna, an active member from Zimbabwe, volunteered to go through the Google Cloud for Startups funding application process live during the meeting. The goal was to demystify the process for others, especially those from regions with less access to startup resources, and to create a repeatable pathway for other community members to obtain AI credits.

### Step-by-Step Progress

1. **Initial Application Attempt:**
   - 3Hunna began by navigating to the Google Cloud for Startups application page.
   - He was prompted to provide a business email, domain, and other company details.
   - The process required a non-Gmail business email and a matching website domain, which he set up using Namecheap.

2. **Billing Account Setup:**
   - Google required an active billing account linked to the business.
   - 3Hunna encountered issues with his initial credit card and had to update his payment method.
   - After updating, he successfully activated his billing account.

3. **Application Form Details:**
   - The form asked about the startup’s funding stage (bootstrapped, friends/family, pre-seed, etc.).
   - 3Hunna selected the options that best matched his situation (bootstrapped, supported by grants/friends/family).
   - He was also asked to list any accelerators or platform partners; “deorganized media” was suggested as a reference.

4. **Domain and Email Verification:**
   - A key requirement was that the admin email domain must match the website domain.
   - 3Hunna ensured these matched, but still encountered a recurring error about the billing account and domain mismatch.

5. **Troubleshooting and Community Support:**
   - The group collaboratively troubleshooted, suggesting steps like refreshing the application, re-verifying domains, and waiting for Google’s systems to update (which can take 24–48 hours).
   - 3Hunna was encouraged to try the “pre-funded startups” application path, which is designed for startups without prior institutional funding.

6. **Outcome (as of Meeting End):**
   - Despite successfully setting up the billing account and matching domains, the application process was not fully completed during the session due to persistent verification errors.
   - The group agreed this was a valuable learning experience, and 3Hunna planned to retry after waiting for system updates or to contact Google support if issues persisted.

### Key Takeaways

- **Transparency:** 3Hunna’s willingness to go through the process live provided invaluable insight into the real-world hurdles faced by founders, especially in Africa.
- **Barriers Identified:** The main obstacles were around business infrastructure (domain, email, billing) and Google’s strict verification requirements.
- **Community Learning:** The session produced a step-by-step “playbook” for others to follow, including tips on business setup, billing, and application navigation.
- **Resilience:** 3Hunna’s persistence and the group’s support exemplified the Guild’s ethos of learning through doing and not being discouraged by setbacks.

### Quotes from the Session

- “This is the most important thing we could do today. Attract funding to every startup in this room.”
- “If you can unlock $5,000 of AI credits for your startup because you have a domain, then there’s nothing stopping anyone in this room from doing the exact same thing.”
- “Consistency is key. If you show up relentlessly, good things will happen regardless.”

**Summary:**  
While 3Hunna did not secure the credits during the meeting, his progress illuminated the process, highlighted common pitfalls, and set the stage for future success—both for himself and for other Guild members. The group’s collaborative troubleshooting and documentation of the process will make it easier for others to follow in his footsteps.

## Effectiveness
- The meeting was highly effective in:
  - Lowering barriers to entry for new builders.
  - Providing actionable steps for accessing funding and AI resources.
  - Encouraging a culture of experimentation, resilience, and mutual support.
  - Highlighting the value of network effects and asynchronous collaboration.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. **Continue Weekly Sessions:** Maintain regular meetings focused on practical progress, mentorship, and collaborative project launches.
2. **Document Funding Processes:** Create step-by-step guides for AI credit applications and share successful pathways with the community.
3. **Expand Resource Sharing:** Build a shared repository of tools, templates, and tutorials for rapid onboarding.
4. **Track Outcomes:** Encourage members to document and share their progress, learnings, and project milestones.
5. **Foster Inclusivity:** Continue to support members from underrepresented regions and backgrounds, ensuring equitable access to opportunities.
